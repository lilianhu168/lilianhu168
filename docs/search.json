    "text": "Higher education has long been seen as a gateway to economic opportunity, yet access to top-tier institutions remains highly stratified by socioeconomic status. This analysis explores the relationship between parental income and college attendance rates across different tiers of higher education, including Ivy Plus schools, highly selective public and private colleges, and other elite institutions. Understanding these patterns is crucial for evaluating whether higher education promotes upward mobility or reinforces existing economic inequalities. By analyzing data from the TidyTuesday College Admissions data set, this study seeks to uncover whether students from lower-income backgrounds have equitable access to prestigious institutions and what structural barriers may contribute to disparities in attendance rates. These findings can inform discussions around financial aid policies, admissions practices, and broader efforts to make higher education more accessible to all.\nThe data set used in this analysis comes from The data set used in this analysis comes from TidyTuesday. The original source of the College Admissions data set is the Opportunity Insights project via an article, which provides data on the relationship between parental income and higher education access. This data set includes information on college attendance rates across different income percentiles, categorized by institution selectivity. By leveraging this data, we aim to quantify the disparities in college access and analyze how income influences educational opportunities."

    "text": "Discussion\nThese findings underscore the structural barriers that lower-income students face when trying to access elite education. While highly selective public schools provide relatively better opportunities, the overall trend still indicates that socioeconomic background plays a determining role in college access. Addressing these disparities requires stronger financial aid programs, increased outreach efforts, and potential reforms in legacy admissions policies. Additionally, further research could explore how financial aid impacts attendance rates over time or examine the long-term effects of socioeconomic stratification in higher education.\nOverall, this analysis highlights the persistent inequalities in college admissions and emphasizes the need for policies that promote greater access and equity in higher education."

    "text": "Scenario Description and Data Science Component\nAlgorithmic sentiment analysis in the financial markets utilized advanced natural language processing (NLP) and making learning techniques to transform unstructured textual data from social media, news articles, and financial reporters into actionable signals for trading. By processing large amounts of real-time data, these systems are capable of detecting shifts in the market sentiment with impressive speed and precision. For example, recent research from Transforming Sentiment Analysis in the Financial Domain with ChatGPT demonstrates that integrating large language models that are properly prompt-engineered can significantly improve the accuracy of sentiment classification and its correlation with market returns. This technical advancements are similarly aligned with insights from PyQuant News, where sentiment analysis is shown to democratize financial decision-making by providing individual investors access to tools that are traditionally reserved for larger institutions.\nFurthermore, the article Bank of England says AI software could create market crisis for profit from the Guardian indicates concerns that while such systems strengthen efficiency, they also introduce risks like the possibility of these algorithms being manipulated to deliberately induce market volatility. In practice, the purpose of these algorithms is to preprocess and transform raw data to minimize noise and reveal non-linear market patterns. Its used as a method that enhances the predictive traditional models. However, as studies from both the Butterworths Journal and Penn Carey Law emphasizes the caution on the same “black box” nature that drives these innovations can be exploited by powerful market players to create artificial signals, in turn, potentially undermining market integrity.\nTherefore, the scenario vividly illustrates the dual-edged nature of sentiment analysis as it embodies both the promise of improved market insight and the hazard of misused technology in a highly competitive financial landscape."

    "text": "Literature Review\nThe current discourse on algorithmic sentiment analysis in finance reflects two contrasting narratives that together frame our ethical dilemma. On one side, proponents emphasize democratization and efficiency. Sources such as the Guardian article and PyQuant News assert that sentiment analysis models empower investors by providing real-time, refined insights that previously were only available to large institutions, thereby reducing the traditional information asymmetry in financial markets. The research on ChatGPT-based sentiment analysis further underscores the potential for these models to enhance predictive performance significantly, offering a more nuanced understanding of market dynamics through advanced language models.\nOn the other side, critical perspectives underscore the risks of market manipulation and systemic abuse. Studies from Butterworths Journal and IJCRT expose how the opacity inherent in sophisticated “black box” AI systems can be patronized to distort market sentiment and facilitate manipulative trading practices. Legal analyses from Penn Carey Law further highlight the possibility of collusion among autonomous algorithms, suggesting that the very features that make these models effective for prediction might also enable unethical behaviour. Additionally, ethical discussions in IRJMETS illuminate concerns regarding bias, fairness, and data privacy in these systems, emphasizing that without stringent oversight, sentiment analysis may inadvertently contribute to market instability. Together, these sources not only inform our technical understanding of sentiment analysis in finance but also frame the broader ethical debate, illustrating the tension between technological advancement and the imperative for robust regulation to ensure that innovation does not compromise market fairness."

    "section": "Analysis of Ethical Data Questions",
    "text": "Analysis of Ethical Data Questions\n\n1. What is the permission structure for using the data? Was it followed?\nIn algorithmic sentiment analysis, the primary data sources are tweets, news articles, and public social media posts that are commonly assumed to be free for use by virtue of being publicly available. However, this raises a critical ethical challenge: even if the data are public, individuals may not be aware that their posts or opinions are being harvested and repurposed for high-stakes financial trading decisions. The IRJMETS paper highlights the need for robust data governance policies to ensure that even public data are handled in a way that respects privacy and informed consent. In our example, although the technical frameworks for scraping public data are well established and legally permissible, there remains an ethical question over whether the implicit permission granted by public availability is sufficient for their use in profit-driven research. Without more explicit user consent or clear disclosures, the utilization of this data—even as part of a sophisticated sentiment analysis system—continues to operate in a gray area that demands closer scrutiny.\n\n\n2. What was the data collection process? Were the observations collected ethically? Are there missing observations?\nThe data collection process for sentiment analysis involves automated techniques (e.g., web scraping and API-based ingestion) to aggregate large volumes of text from diverse sources. As demonstrated by advanced approaches like the ChatGPT-based sentiment analysis model, pre-processing steps are implemented to filter noise and isolate meaningful patterns from raw data. Ethically, however, the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the data collection process must be evaluated to ensure no systemic bias or unintentional omission of significant data points. Reports in IJCRT and studies in the Butterworths Journal indicate that lapses like missing critical time windows or skewed sampling due to rate limits, can inadvertently bias the final sentiment score, thereby potentially distorting market predictions. Although our system achieves remarkable efficiency in processing large datasets, it is vital that constant validation measures and error-detection protocols are employed to prevent missing observations and maintain the ethical integrity of the research.\n\n\n3. Were the data made publicly available and are they identifiable? Are they sufficiently anonymized?\nThe data used in our sentiment analysis model are sourced from publicly available content, and while they may seem inherently anonymous, advanced processing techniques can sometimes enable the reassembly of metadata that may reveal identifiable patterns. For instance, when aggregating data from individual tweets or news articles, contextual cues such as time stamps or location markers might inadvertently facilitate user identification. Research from Penn Carey Law and Butterworths Journal has shown that “black box” AI systems often operate without adequate transparency, making it difficult to ascertain if the data are fully anonymized. Thus, while the sentiment data are public, ethical standards require that any identifiable details be rigorously removed or aggregated. Our data processing pipeline is designed to strip out excessive metadata and rely on aggregated sentiment indices rather than individual-level data, addressing these privacy concerns and conforming with ethical principles for data handling in sensitive environments.\n\n\n4. Is the data being used in unintended ways compared to the original study?\nA fundamental concern in using sentiment analysis in financial markets is the possibility that data may be repurposed beyond its originally intended meaning. Initially, the goal of sentiment analysis is to measure genuine public opinion and market mood, yet there exists a danger that these data streams could be co-opted to artificially influence market conditions. Sources from IJCRT and the Penn Carey Law study reveal that advanced AI systems—by operating as opaque “black boxes” can be utilized to create manipulated signals that induce or exacerbate market volatility. In our scenario, while the intended use of sentiment data is to inform and optimize trading strategies, there remains a risk that such algorithms could be reconfigured or exploited by larger market players to manipulate outcomes intentionally. Hence, continuous monitoring and regulatory oversight are necessary to ensure that data are used for genuine market insight rather than being repurposed to serve profit-driven manipulative agendas.\n\n\n5. Who was measured? Are those individuals representative of the target population?\nAn essential consideration in evaluating the ethical use of sentiment analysis is understanding the demographics of the data sources. Typically, the sentiment data come from active social media users or readers of prominent financial news outlets. While these sources provide a rich reservoir of opinions, they may not accurately represent the broader investing public. Academic literature and analysis on market sentiment (as referenced in Wikipedia’s entries on sentiment and market sentiment indicate that there is an inherent selection bias toward individuals who are more active online. This could skew sentiment indices in ways that over represent particular views or behaviours, especially if the demographics of social media users differ significantly from the overall investor population. In our system, although the data capture is efficient and extensive, there is an ethical duty to recognize that the insights derived may only reflect a subset of market participants. This imbalance necessitates caution when generalizing findings across the entire market, as the over representation of a specific group could inadvertently lead to strategies that favour those with privileged access to the sentiment data."

    "text": "Discussion and Reflection\nIntegrating insights from multiple sources reveals a significant ethical tension in the use of algorithmic sentiment analysis in financial markets. On one hand, advanced NLP techniques and AI models empower retail investors by providing them with timely and sophisticated market insights. This democratization of data and prediction tools has the potential to level the playing field, allowing individual investors to access information that was once exclusive to large financial institutions. On the other hand, numerous studies caution that the same advanced technologies can be exploited to manipulate market sentiment and destabilize financial systems. The inherent “black box” nature of many AI systems, coupled with the challenges of ensuring ethical data collection and maintaining transparency, heightens the risk of misuse. These risks underscore the need for rigorous regulatory oversight and robust ethical frameworks. In reflecting on these divergent perspectives, it becomes clear that while technological advancements can improve market efficiency and forecasting accuracy, they must be balanced by safeguarding measures that prevent abusive practices and protect individual privacy."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis project has explored the ethical dilemma at the intersection of algorithmic sentiment analysis and financial markets by examining both its transformative potential and its inherent risks. On one side, advanced AI models offer enhanced market transparency, improved risk management, and more democratized access to financial insights, as evidenced by recent studies and industry reports. On the other side, the opacity of these models and their potential for exploitation raise serious concerns regarding market manipulation, systemic risk, and ethical accountability. The analysis has highlighted key issues such as the permission structure for data usage, the rigor of the data collection process, and the balancing of benefits against unintended consequences. Ultimately, to harness the promise of sentiment analysis while mitigating its risks, it is essential that market participants, regulators, and ethicists work collaboratively to develop adaptable regulatory frameworks and enforce transparent, accountable data practices. By fostering ongoing dialogue and integrating ethical principles into the design and deployment of AI systems, we can strive to ensure that technological innovation advances market efficiency without compromising fairness or stability."

These results align perfectly with Bayesian probability theory, where the host’s action of opening 98 doors concentrates the initial 1% chance of being wrong into a single remaining door. The findings underscore a fundamental cognitive bias: human intuition often fails to account for how information revelation reshapes probability distributions, as evidenced by Granberg and Brown’s (1995) studies showing 87% of participants initially prefer the inferior stay strategy. This paradox highlights the counterintuitive nature of conditional probability, where seemingly negligible initial probabilities (1/100) transform into near-certainty (99/100) through systematic information updating.\nConclusion The Monty Hall problem serves as a profound case study in statistical literacy, emphasizing that optimal decision-making requires dynamic probability reassessment when new information emerges. Beyond theoretical interest, these insights have practical implications for machine learning algorithms, game theory, and real-world scenarios where incremental information reveals critical advantages. By marrying computational simulation with mathematical proof, this study reinforces that switching doors isn’t just advantageous—it’s mathematically dominant, a principle scalable to any decision framework involving information asymmetry."

These results align perfectly with Bayesian probability theory, where the host’s action of opening 98 doors concentrates the initial 1% chance of being wrong into a single remaining door. The findings underscore a fundamental cognitive bias: human intuition often fails to account for how information revelation reshapes probability distributions, as evidenced by Granberg and Brown’s (1995) studies showing 87% of participants initially prefer the inferior stay strategy. This paradox highlights the counterintuitive nature of conditional probability, where seemingly negligible initial probabilities (1/100) transform into near-certainty (99/100) through systematic information updating.\nConclusion The Monty Hall problem serves as a profound case study in statistical literacy, emphasizing that optimal decision-making requires dynamic probability reassessment when new information emerges. Beyond theoretical interest, these insights have practical implications for machine learning algorithms, game theory, and real-world scenarios where incremental information reveals critical advantages. By marrying computational simulation with mathematical proof, this study reinforces that switching doors isn’t just advantageous—it’s mathematically dominant, a principle scalable to any decision framework involving information asymmetry."

The selection was based on a mix of states with varying geographical, economic, and healthcare profiles. High-employment and high-wage states such as California and New York were included alongside states with different economic and healthcare characteristics, such as West Virginia and Nevada. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of how factors like urbanization, cost of living, and healthcare infrastructure impact RN workforce distribution and salary trends."

    "text": "Results\nThe first plot visualizes the total employment of registered nurses over time across the selected states. The results show a clear disparity between states, with California having the largest number of employed RNs, followed by New York and Florida. In contrast, states such as West Virginia and Nevada consistently exhibit much lower RN employment levels, reflecting their smaller populations and healthcare demands. Notably, California shows steady employment growth, particularly from 2010 onward, while other states exhibit a more gradual increase or stagnation.\nThe second plot examines the average annual salary of RNs over time. Salaries have increased across all states, but at different rates. California stands out with the highest RN salaries, exceeding $125,000 in recent years, while states like West Virginia and Idaho have significantly lower salary growth, remaining below $80,000. The gap between high-paying and low-paying states has widened over time, with West Coast states generally showing stronger salary increases compared to some East Coast states."

    "text": "Discussion\nThe results highlight key differences in RN employment and salaries based on economic and regional factors. California’s high employment and rising wages align with its position as the most populous state, where demand for healthcare professionals is consistently strong. Additionally, California has strict nurse-to-patient ratio laws, requiring hospitals to employ more nurses, which likely contributes to both higher employment numbers and competitive salaries.\nNew York and Florida, while also showing high employment levels, exhibit different trends. Florida has a large aging population, which increases healthcare demand, yet its wage growth is slower compared to California. New York, with its major metropolitan healthcare hubs, maintains strong employment and salary growth, though not as pronounced as California.\nConversely, West Virginia and Idaho consistently report lower RN employment and salaries, reflecting their smaller healthcare infrastructures and rural populations. West Virginia, in particular, has faced challenges with retaining healthcare workers, as many nurses seek higher-paying opportunities in neighbouring states. Similarly, Idaho’s lower wages suggest fewer resources allocated to healthcare personnel, which may impact nurse retention and recruitment.\nA notable trend is the wage gap between coasts. West Coast states, especially California and Washington, have seen stronger salary growth compared to many East Coast states. This could be attributed to differences in cost of living, labor laws, and healthcare funding. Additionally, states like Hawaii and Nevada show unique trends, where wages have risen significantly despite having a smaller RN workforce, possibly due to workforce shortages requiring higher pay to attract nurses.\nOverall, this analysis underscores the regional disparities in RN employment and wages, emphasizing the role of economic conditions, healthcare policies, and geographic challenges in shaping the nursing workforce. These findings are crucial for policymakers and healthcare administrators seeking to address workforce shortages, improve salary competitiveness, and ensure adequate healthcare staffing across different regions."

This analysis supports our key question by uncovering which stocks tend to be grouped together in financial discussions and how these relationships may reflect market trends or competitive dynamics.\n\ntweets_with_multiple_tickers &lt;- tweets |&gt;\n  group_by(text_clean) |&gt;\n  summarise(tickers = list(unique(tickers_found)), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  filter(lengths(tickers) &gt; 1)\n\nstock_pairs &lt;- tweets_with_multiple_tickers |&gt;\n  mutate(pairs = map(tickers, ~combn(.x, 2, simplify = FALSE))) |&gt;\n  unnest(pairs) |&gt;\n  transmute(ticker1 = map_chr(pairs, 1), ticker2 = map_chr(pairs, 2)) |&gt;\n  count(ticker1, ticker2, sort = TRUE)\n\ntop_stock_pairs &lt;- stock_pairs |&gt; slice_max(order_by = n, n = 10)\n\nggplot(top_stock_pairs, aes(x = ticker1, y = ticker2, size = n)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Top 10 Most Commonly Co-Mentioned Stocks\",\n    x = \"Stock 1\",\n    y = \"Stock 2\",\n    size = \"Number of Co-Mentions\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()"
