    "text": "Higher education has long been seen as a gateway to economic opportunity, yet access to top-tier institutions remains highly stratified by socioeconomic status. This analysis explores the relationship between parental income and college attendance rates across different tiers of higher education, including Ivy Plus schools, highly selective public and private colleges, and other elite institutions. Understanding these patterns is crucial for evaluating whether higher education promotes upward mobility or reinforces existing economic inequalities. By analyzing data from the TidyTuesday College Admissions data set, this study seeks to uncover whether students from lower-income backgrounds have equitable access to prestigious institutions and what structural barriers may contribute to disparities in attendance rates. These findings can inform discussions around financial aid policies, admissions practices, and broader efforts to make higher education more accessible to all.\nThe data set used in this analysis comes from The data set used in this analysis comes from TidyTuesday. The original source of the College Admissions data set is the Opportunity Insights project via an article, which provides data on the relationship between parental income and higher education access. This data set includes information on college attendance rates across different income percentiles, categorized by institution selectivity. By leveraging this data, we aim to quantify the disparities in college access and analyze how income influences educational opportunities."

    "text": "Discussion\nThese findings underscore the structural barriers that lower-income students face when trying to access elite education. While highly selective public schools provide relatively better opportunities, the overall trend still indicates that socioeconomic background plays a determining role in college access. Addressing these disparities requires stronger financial aid programs, increased outreach efforts, and potential reforms in legacy admissions policies. Additionally, further research could explore how financial aid impacts attendance rates over time or examine the long-term effects of socioeconomic stratification in higher education.\nOverall, this analysis highlights the persistent inequalities in college admissions and emphasizes the need for policies that promote greater access and equity in higher education."

The selection was based on a mix of states with varying geographical, economic, and healthcare profiles. High-employment and high-wage states such as California and New York were included alongside states with different economic and healthcare characteristics, such as West Virginia and Nevada. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of how factors like urbanization, cost of living, and healthcare infrastructure impact RN workforce distribution and salary trends."

The results show a clear disparity between states, with California having the largest number of employed RNs, followed by New York and Florida. In contrast, states such as West Virginia and Nevada consistently exhibit much lower RN employment levels, reflecting their smaller populations and healthcare demands. Notably, California shows steady employment growth, particularly from 2010 onward, while other states exhibit a more gradual increase or stagnation.\nThe second plot examines the average annual salary of RNs over time. Salaries have increased across all states, but at different rates. California stands out with the highest RN salaries, exceeding $125,000 in recent years, while states like West Virginia and Idaho have significantly lower salary growth, remaining below $80,000. The gap between high-paying and low-paying states has widened over time, with West Coast states generally showing stronger salary increases compared to some East Coast states."

    "text": "Discussion\nThe results highlight key differences in RN employment and salaries based on economic and regional factors. California’s high employment and rising wages align with its position as the most populous state, where demand for healthcare professionals is consistently strong. Additionally, California has strict nurse-to-patient ratio laws, requiring hospitals to employ more nurses, which likely contributes to both higher employment numbers and competitive salaries.\nNew York and Florida, while also showing high employment levels, exhibit different trends. Florida has a large aging population, which increases healthcare demand, yet its wage growth is slower compared to California. New York, with its major metropolitan healthcare hubs, maintains strong employment and salary growth, though not as pronounced as California.\nConversely, West Virginia and Idaho consistently report lower RN employment and salaries, reflecting their smaller healthcare infrastructures and rural populations. West Virginia, in particular, has faced challenges with retaining healthcare workers, as many nurses seek higher-paying opportunities in neighbouring states. Similarly, Idaho’s lower wages suggest fewer resources allocated to healthcare personnel, which may impact nurse retention and recruitment.\nA notable trend is the wage gap between coasts. West Coast states, especially California and Washington, have seen stronger salary growth compared to many East Coast states. This could be attributed to differences in cost of living, labor laws, and healthcare funding. Additionally, states like Hawaii and Nevada show unique trends, where wages have risen significantly despite having a smaller RN workforce, possibly due to workforce shortages requiring higher pay to attract nurses.\nOverall, this analysis underscores the regional disparities in RN employment and wages, emphasizing the role of economic conditions, healthcare policies, and geographic challenges in shaping the nursing workforce. These findings are crucial for policymakers and healthcare administrators seeking to address workforce shortages, improve salary competitiveness, and ensure adequate healthcare staffing across different regions."
