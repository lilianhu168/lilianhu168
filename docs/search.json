    "text": "###Introduction Higher education has long been seen as a gateway to economic opportunity, yet access to top-tier institutions remains highly stratified by socioeconomic status. This analysis explores the relationship between parental income and college attendance rates across different tiers of higher education, including Ivy Plus schools, highly selective public and private colleges, and other elite institutions. Understanding these patterns is crucial for evaluating whether higher education promotes upward mobility or reinforces existing economic inequalities. By analyzing data from the TidyTuesday College Admissions data set, this study seeks to uncover whether students from lower-income backgrounds have equitable access to prestigious institutions and what structural barriers may contribute to disparities in attendance rates. These findings can inform discussions around financial aid policies, admissions practices, and broader efforts to make higher education more accessible to all.\nThe data set used in this analysis comes from The data set used in this analysis comes from TidyTuesday. The original source of the College Admissions data set is the Opportunity Insights project, which provides data on the relationship between parental income and higher education access. This data set includes information on college attendance rates across different income percentiles, categorized by institution selectivity. By leveraging this data, we aim to quantify the disparities in college access and analyze how income influences educational opportunities."

    "text": "Discussion\nThese findings underscore the structural barriers that lower-income students face when trying to access elite education. While highly selective public schools provide relatively better opportunities, the overall trend still indicates that socioeconomic background plays a determining role in college access. Addressing these disparities requires stronger financial aid programs, increased outreach efforts, and potential reforms in legacy admissions policies. Additionally, further research could explore how financial aid impacts attendance rates over time or examine the long-term effects of socioeconomic stratification in higher education.\nOverall, this analysis highlights the persistent inequalities in college admissions and emphasizes the need for policies that promote greater access and equity in higher education."
